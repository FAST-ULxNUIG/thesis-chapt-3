## Summary

This repository contains the code for Chapter 3 of Edward Gunning's Ph.D. thesis. It mainly deals with the processing and preparation of the RISC dataset for analysis. 

## Repository Structure

* :open_file_folder: <b>[code](code/)</b>
   * 📁 <b>[analysis](code/analysis/)</b> -- scripts used to perform all the steps of the data analysis (i.e., processing and preparation of the RISC dataset). The [master script](code/analysis/00-data-preparation-master-script.R) runs all of the steps sequentially. 
   * 📁 <b>[figures](code/figures/)</b> -- scripts to produce figures presented in chapter 3 of the thesis.
   * 📁 <b>[functions](code/functions/)</b> -- custom functions written for data processing and preparation.
* :open_file_folder: <b>[outputs](outputs/)</b>
   * 📁 <b>[basis-expansion-diagram](outputs/basis-expansion-diagram/)</b> -- files to produce the flow chart for the basis expansion.
   * 📁 <b>[data](outputs/data/)</b> -- intermediate copies of the dataset saved at various stages of the analysis (<i>not publicly available</i>).
   * 📁 <b>[plots](outputs/plots/)</b> -- outputs of figures made during the process. Most are outputted as `.tex` files and are compiled in the [](outputs/plots/figures.tex) master file. Some are compiled locally in `R` so a `.pdf` and `.tex` version is stored.
  * 📁 <b>[tables](outputs/tables/)</b> tables created at different stages of the process.
* :open_file_folder: <b>[data](data/)</b> initial copies of the raw datasets (<i>not publicly available</i>)
