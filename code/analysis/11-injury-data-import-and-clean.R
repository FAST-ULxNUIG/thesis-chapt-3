# regular basis during the last year and has completed â‰¤10km
# total training volume per week during the preceding year
# (Nielsen et al., 2013).
# A recreational runner was defined as a person who runsa minimum of 10km
# per week, for at least six months prior to inclusion in the study
# (Saragiotto et al., 2014).

# as the competitive runners were all also recreational,
# but they also competed in events.
